    "### Prior to working on this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Watch the videos on the experiment and work out at least exercises 2 and 3 on the mean free path of electrons in the mercury F-H tube given in the experiment instructions.  These will be relevant to the \"RSB\" method of analyzing Franck-Hertz data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Read through the paper by Rapior, Sengstock and Baev (RSB) linked on the experiment page: Rapior, G., K. Sengstock, and V Baev, <a href=\"http://courses.washington.edu/phys432/restricted/AJP_rapior_sengstock_baev.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">\"New features of the Franck-Hertz experiment,\"</a> <i>Am. J. Phys.,</i> <strong>74</strong>, p. 423-428 (2006).  Also study the lecture notes on this paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Download the PDFs of the chart-recorder scans for the two Franck-Hertz data runs (one for Hg, the other for Ne).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Extract from the scans the positions in paper-grid units of (1) calibration marks, (2) positions of anode current minima (\"troughs\") and maxima (\"peaks\"), and, for neon (3) positions of the small features (tiny peaks and troughs) seen in the neon-scan lock-in amp output.  The separations of similar features will be used to estimate the 3s-3p state separation.  **You do not need to estimate the uncertainty in these measurements**, but make your estimates of position to within 1/10 of small square.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Assign numbers to each anode current feature, for example, 1, 2, 3,... for peak 1, peak 2, peak 3... and similarly for the troughs.  (Not necessary for the Ne lock-in scan; these will be analyzed differently.)\n",
    "\n",

    "6. Create spreadsheets with these data to be read into the notebook for further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks for this notebook\n",

    "For the neon data set:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Plot and fit the calibration data.  Create a calibration function to turn feature positions into voltages.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Apply the calibration to all of the position measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* For the anode current peaks and troughs, analyze each set in three different ways:\n",
    "  1. Fit a line through the peak/trough position vs. number.  From this obtain the average energy difference.\n",
    "  2. Fit a quadratic through the peak/trough positions vs. number.  From this obtain the fit parameters to use in the RSB formalism.\n",
    "  3. Take first differences of the peak/trough positions, and plot/fit these to a line.  The fit line should extrapolate to the energy of the first excited state, acccording to the RSB formalism.  Test this idea with a calculation from the fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* From the measurements taken from the lock-in scan for neon, take differences between adjacent features that indicate transitions between the 3s and 3p states.  Look at the list of differences to see if they have about the same value, and check any outliers against the original XY plot.  Then calculate an average and uncertainty to compare to the expected 1.7 V average separation between these states.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the mercury data set:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Plot and fit the calibration data.  Create a calibration function to turn feature positions into voltages.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Apply the calibration to all of the position measurements.\n",

    "* Use the fit coefficients associated with the RSB method to estimate the mean free path of the electrons between collisions with Hg atoms.  You will also need a dimension from the picture of the Hg tube.  Compare this result to the one calculated from the exercises and to the results cited by RSB in their paper.\n"
